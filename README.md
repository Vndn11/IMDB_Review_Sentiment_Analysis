Na誰ve Bayes Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Review Dataset


1. Introduction
This project implements a Na誰ve Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The classifier determines whether a review is positive or negative based on text-based feature extraction and probability-based classification. The implementation follows a step-by-step text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation process.

2. Dataset Overview
The dataset used is the IMDB Dataset.csv, which consists of movie reviews along with their sentiment labels (positive/negative).
Training Set: A user-defined percentage (e.g., 80% or 70%) of the dataset.
Test Set: The remaining portion of the dataset (e.g., 20% or 30%).

3. Preprocessing Steps
To prepare the text for analysis, several preprocessing steps are applied:

3.1 Lowercasing
All text is converted to lowercase to maintain uniformity:

3.2 Remove HTML Tags
Removes unnecessary HTML tags:

3.3 Remove URLs
Eliminates hyperlinks:

3.4 Remove Punctuation
Removes all punctuation marks to clean text:

3.5 Handling Chatwords
Common internet slang (chatwords) are replaced with their full forms:

3.6 Remove Stopwords
Common stopwords (e.g., "is", "the", "and") are removed using NLTK:

3.7 Remove Emojis
Removes emoji characters:

3.8 Tokenization and Lemmatization
Each review is split into words (tokens) and converted to their root form:

4. Feature Engineering
To convert text into a numerical representation, Bag-of-Words (BoW) is used.

4.1 Create Vocabulary
Extracts unique words from the dataset:

4.2 Create Binary Bag of Words Representation
Converts each review into a sparse binary vector:

5. Training Na誰ve Bayes Classifier
Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability of a class given the words in the review is calculated:
